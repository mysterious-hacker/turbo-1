## Vision

A free, open, modern [SuperMemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo)-[like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) (with [incremental reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading)) + [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

A place for learning, reading, _and_ gardening your personal knowledge graph.

## Why

A platform for applying [optimization methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) to human potential.

## Core Tech Stack (subject to change)

- Svelte
- urql
- Chrome/Chromium/iOS Safari
- GraphQL
- Juniper
- Rust, in the form of a Node.js native plugin (possibly via Electron, possibly not)
- SQLite

## Status

In active development, updated January 2021.

Not yet ready for out-of-the-box use.

Contributions of all forms are very much welcome! (code, ideas, evangelism strike force, etc.)

## Community

Use practices from the Rust community as a template for a large, open, community-driven project based on shared goals.
